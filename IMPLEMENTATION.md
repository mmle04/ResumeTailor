Michael implemented the intial functions that made retrieving the input files and making sure that the files are of the correct type. AI tools were used to help create file_loader.py. The rest was done without AI. The generated code will ask the user to input the path of the file they want to analyze (resume and job description) and will only accept .docx format. It does exactly what is expected, giving an error when the file isn't the correct type. No additional modifications were necessary for the prompts to get the correct code for file_loader.py.

Timothy implemented gemini.py, which imports the Gemini AI client into our project. This allows us to prompt it with whatever we want, using our API key (free). These two websites were referenced to help create the class: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfWpPEgea2A, https://aistudio.google.com/. The function takes in whatever is outputted from job_parser and resume_parser from main and prompts Gemini to analyze it, returning specifically a JSON result with all the results we are looking for to make it easier when we implement the front end.

Robert worked on initial implementation of job_parser.py. The code will parse through a job listing, extracting important keyboards from the listing and outputting them and more into a file that will be taken in by gemini.py. Currently, the job_parser.py file will need more work and attention in the future.
